                <p>I like to make notations in my books or on paper while I read. Sharing those is intimate and impractical, but this is a similar way of sharing things I found interesting (or funny). So heres a button that gives you random quotes i liked from books ive read or authors I like. Unfortunately, some lose some value when starved of context, so you should like read that book. This list isn't complete, and it likely never will be.</p>

            <p >And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'</p>
            <p >isn't it crazy how people place so much value in quotes, like 99% they're just random shit someone said or wrote in a book but without all of the context of the book that helped give that quote context and meaning. But when I share quotes I like its a totally different thing and is very cool. i mean they are all (actually, mostly?) from books ive read but you still have none of that context lol.
                I try to include quotes that are from texts or people that really made me think, rather than ones that feel surface-level like 'try your hardest' kinda shit, and i like thinking. sometimes. ok maybe rarely, but still.

            <p>One of the few good things about modern times: If you die horribly on television, you will not have died in vain. You will have entertained us.</p>
            <p>Science is magic that works.</p>
            <p>What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.</p>
            <p>We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?</p>
            <p>Don't ask for guarantees. And don't look to be saved in any one thing, person, machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were heading for shore.</p>

            <p>The country was in peril; he was jeopardizing his traditional rights of freedom and independence by daring to exercise them.</p>
            <p>'What do you do when it rains?' The captain answered frankly. 'I get wet.'</p>
            <p>I once knew an Episcopalian lady in Newport, Rhode Island, who asked me to design and build a doghouse for her Great Dane. The lady claimed to understand God and his Ways of Working perfectly. She could not understand why anyone should be puzzled about what had been or about what was going to be. And yet, when I showed her a blueprint of the doghouse I proposed to build, she said to me, 'I’m sorry, but I never could read one of those things.' 'Give it to your husband or your minister to pass on to God,' I said, 'and, when God finds a minute, I’m sure he’ll explain this doghouse of mine in a way that even you can understand.' She fired me. I shall never forget her. She believed that God liked people in sailboats much better than he liked people in motorboats. She could not bear to look at a worm. When she saw a worm, she screamed. She was a fool, and so am I, and so is anyone who thinks he sees what God is Doing, [writes Bokonon].</p>
            <p>Several of them would have protested if they could have found the right arguments.</p>
            <p>Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on--that is, badly.</p>
            <p>Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer—except, of course, for the pigs and the dogs.</p>
            <p>'Up there, comrades,' he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large beak – 'up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see – there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!' He even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges. Many of the animals believed him.</p>
            <p>What do you despise? By this are you truly known.</p>
            <p>There is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors.</p>
            <p>It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.</p>
            <p>Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.</p>
            <p>Governments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms. No government in history has been known to evade this pattern. And as the aristocracy develops, government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class - whether that class be hereditary royalty, oligarchs of financial empires, or entrenched bureaucracy.

            <p>We all had our miseries. But to despair was to wish back for something already lost. Or to prolong what was already unbearable. <br> -Suyuan</p>
            <p>We can destroy what we have written, but we cannot unwrite it.</p>
            <p>What a slut time is. She screws everybody.</p>
            <p>I had a happy childhood, but I was not a happy child.</p>
            <p>A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story seems moral, do not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.</p>
            <p>you can tell a true war story if it embarrasses you. If you don't care for obscenity, you don't care for the truth; if you don't care for the truth, watch how you vote. Send guys to war, they come home talking dirty. </p>
            <p>A thing may happen and be a total lie; another thing may not happen and be truer than the truth.</p>
            <p>Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to. It was what had brought them to the war in the first place, nothing positive, no dreams of glory or honor, just to avoid the blush of dishonor. They died so as not to die of embarrassment.</p>
            <p>Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.</p>
            <p>Scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty.</p>
            <p>Now any dogma, based primarily on faith and emotionalism, is a dangerous weapon to use on others, since it is almost impossible to guarantee that the weapon will never be turned on the user.</p>
            <p>It was childish to feel disappointed, but childishness comes almost as naturally to a man as to a child.</p>
            <p>It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety.</p>
            <p>I wanted to be a psychological engineer, but we lacked the facilities, so I did the next best thing - I went into politics. It's practically the same thing.</p>
            <p>'You mean that this is a matter of patriotism and traders aren't patriotic?' <br> 'Notoriously not. Pioneers never are.'</p>
            <p>'It lacks glamour?' <br>- 'It lacks mob emotion-appeal.' <br>- 'Same thing.'</p>
            <p>It's out of fashion in these decaying times to be a scholar.</p>
            <p>If I could be half the person my dog is, I'd be twice the human I am.</p>
            <p>Sometimes when I'm brushing my teeth, I'll look at the mirror and I swear my reflection seems kind of disappointed. I realized a couple of years ago that not only am I not super-skilled at anything, I'm not even particularly good at being myself.</p>
            <p>Failure is easy to measure. Failure is an event.Harder to measure is insignificance. A nonevent. Insignificance creeps, it dawns, it gives you hope, then delusion, then one day, when you’re not looking, it’s there, at your front door, on your desk, in the mirror, or not, not any of that, it’s the lack of all that. One day, when you are looking, it’s not looking, no one is. You lie in your bed and realize that if you don’t get out of bed and into the world today, it is very likely no one will even notice.</p>
