            <p>Y'know whats better then having your readme on your profile? Having a page with the same shit as your readme on it.</p>

            <p>I like to make notations in my books or on paper while I read. Sharing those is intimate and impractical, but this is a similar way of sharing things I found interesting (or funny). So heres a button that gives you random quotes i liked (mostly) from books ive read or authors I like. Unfortunately, some lose some value when starved of context, so you should like read that book. This list isn't complete, and it likely never will be.</p>

            <p >And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'</p>
            <p >isn't it crazy how people place so much value in quotes, like 99% they're just random shit someone said or wrote in a book but without all of the context of the book that helped give that quote context and meaning. But when I share quotes I like its a totally different thing and is very cool. i mean they are all (actually, mostly?) from books ive read but you still have none of that context lol.
                <br>I try to include quotes that are from texts or people that really made me think, rather than ones that feel surface-level like 'try your hardest' kinda shit, and i like thinking. sometimes. ok maybe rarely, but still.

            <p>Science is magic that works.</p>
            <p>What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.</p>
            <p>We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?</p>
            <p>Don't ask for guarantees. And don't look to be saved in any one thing, person, machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were heading for shore.</p>
